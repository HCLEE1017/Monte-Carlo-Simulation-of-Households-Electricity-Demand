This is a research of building a bottom-up model that combining the Monte Carlo Simulation and Agent-based Modelling. This model is used to simulate households' electricity demand and estimated the residential peak demand. The model could also estimate the probability of watt for a particular device.

This model is built using Python3, Flask, sqlite3, HTML and CSS.

In order to access this model, there are two steps you have to do.

Step 1. Following the requirement.txt to install the packages

Step 2. Typing python3 ./server.py to activate the server and you can use the model.
